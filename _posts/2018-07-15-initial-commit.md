First commit to BrainFlow repository was made. BrainFlow lives on Github in public repository from day 1, so first commit has only basic helpers. 
Some of them like spinlock, data_buffer class, timestamps, etc are still available from the [utils folder](https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/tree/master/src/utils).

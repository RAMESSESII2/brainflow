Built website which you are using right now. Originally we were going to use org domain group, but price to buy it was too high.

[This project](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme) was used as a reference and its creator did a great job!

Also [this post](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-set-up-godaddy-domain-with-github-pages-a9300366c7b) helped a lot to configure godaddy and Github pages.

The [OpenBCI GUI](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_GUI) is OpenBCI's powerful software tool for visualizing, recording, and streaming data from the OpenBCI Boards. Data can be displayed in live-time, played back, saved to your computer in .txt format, as well as streamed in live-time to third-party softwares such as MATLAB. It can be launched as a standalone application or as a sketch from Processing (a Java-based programming language). In this guide, we will cover both scenarios.

[New major release](https://openbci.com/community/gui-v5-release/) of OpenBCI GUI uses **BrainFlow API as a primary data acquisition and signal processing library.**
